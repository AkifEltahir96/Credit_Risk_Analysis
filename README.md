# Credit Risk Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to apply machine learning to predict credit card risk through LendingClub, a credit lending services organization. Using a credit card dataset provided by LendingClub, we will predict lending risk through machine learning models that oversample data, undersample data, and a combinatorial approach (under and oversampling). In addition, we will also use models that reduce bias when predicting risk. Once the analyses are complete, we will make a final recommendation on whether these models should be used to predict credit risk.
